# GraphCovers dataset
Code accompanying my paper ["A Topological characterisation of Weisfeiler-Leman equivalence classes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11876), which will be presented at ICML's workshop Topology, Algebra and Geometry in ML on July 23rd 2022.

In the paper, we give a topological description of all graphs than are indisinguishable using the WL test, and therefore by most message passing Graph Neural Network. We use this description to generate many pairwise non-isomorphic graphs which are indistinguishable by the WL test.

Code is cleaned up.
Readme coming soon...

TODOs:
 - add readme
 - add requirements
 - check TODOs in covers.py
